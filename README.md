* Linux and MacOS requirements: Bash, Perl and Mono

* Linux-only requirements: Coreutils or Busybox


On Linux systems, it's recommended to install Perl and Mono from your native package manager

* Debian: ``` apt install perl mono-runtime ```

## Building (Windows)
Launch compile.bat

## Building (Linux)
Launch compile.sh or, alternatively, launch compile.bat with Wine.

You will be prompted to choose between Wine and Mono, choose whichever you like or have installed in your system.

## Building (MacOS)
Launch compile.sh and choose Mono. You can try and choose Wine, but it's not tested or known if it works.
